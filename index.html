              Hannah made it easy for me to make decisions about the color palette and decorative pieces for my living room. Not only did she guide the process but she took the time to listen to my style/preferences and even went shopping with me, encouraging me to buy pieces that I would not have purchased on my own. Working with Hannah was like working with a best friend. She made decorating a fun, stress free adventure. My new living room is more beautiful than I ever thought it could be!

              What a treat it was for me to get to have Hannah come into my home and make it feel new again. I gave Hannah free reign to move anything and everything. When we came home that evening we felt like we had come home to a place that was fresh and new. She put furniture in places I would never have thought of doing. Our whole downstairs flowed together beautifully. It was obvious that she had spent a lot of time and love in creating the space. I still love it today!
